## Hi 👋 Wei Lee here

I'm a

* [🐍 Python Programmer](https://pycon-note.wei-lee.me/)
* 💻 Remote Worker
* [📷 Traveler](https://travlog.wei-lee.me/)
* 📖 Reader
* 🎵 Ukulele Player
* 🔒 Locker
* 📺 Anime Lover

I enjoy automating tedious tasks and creating high-quality code. Enjoy participating in open-source communities and contributing to open-source projects such as [commitizen-tools](https://github.com/commitizen-tools) is something I love. Traveling is also a passion of mine, and I often use PyCon as an opportunity to explore new places. I have attended PyCon conferences in Taiwan 🇹🇼, the United States 🇺🇸, Japan 🇯🇵, Canada 🇨🇦, Remote Python Pizza 🍕, and Euro Python (remotely) 🇪🇺.

I share my technical notes, book digests, and occasional thoughts on my main blog [Those aren't written down are meant to be forgotten](https://blog.wei-lee.me/). If you're interested in topics such as cooking, anime, and travel, I chat about those things on [Those things no one cares about](https://travlog.wei-lee.me/).
