### Hi there 👋

I'm a

* [🐍 Python Programmer](https://lee-w.github.io/pycon-note/)
* 💻 Remote Worker
* [📷 Traveler](https://lee-w.github.io/travlog/)
* 📖 Reader
* 🎵 Ukulele Player
* 🔒 Locker
* ⭐ Star Wars Fan

Being a lazy software engineer, I like to automate borning stuff and deliver quality code.  
I love traveling and make new friends. Hope to become a PyCon (or tech conf) Nomad and explore the world.

I share my tech note, book review, and sometimes my thought in [my blog](https://lee-w.github.io/).  
I also have [another blog](https://lee-w.github.io/travlog/) which is about movie, anime and traveling.
