## Hi 👋 Wei Lee here

I'm a

* [🐍 Python Programmer](https://pycon-note.wei-lee.me/)
* 💻 Remote Worker
* [📷 Traveler](https://travlog.wei-lee.me/)
* 📖 Reader
* 🎵 Ukulele Player
* 🔒 Locker
* 📺 Anime Lover

As a programmer, I like to automate boring stuff and high-quality code. Enjoy participating in open-source communities and contributing to open-source projects (like [commitizen-tools](https://github.com/commitizen-tools)). Love traveling and would like to use PyCon as an excuse to explore the world 😎. Have been to PyCon TW 🇹🇼, PyCon US 🇺🇸, PyCon JP 🇯🇵, PyCon CA 🇨🇦, Remote Python Pizza 🍕 and Euro Python (remotely ) 🇪🇺.

I share my tech note, book digest, and sometimes my thought in my main blog [Laziness makes Great Engineer](https://blog.wei-lee.me/).

On the other hand, if you're interested in traveling, cooking, and anime, [Meet people around the world](https://travlog.wei-lee.me/) is where I chat about this stuff.
